# CRITICAL FIX: Broken Images on Production

If images are still broken even after uploading new ones, the **Symbolic Link** on your server is missing or broken.

## The Problem
Laravel stores files in `storage/app/public`, but the browser looks for them in `public/storage`. A "symbolic link" connects these two folders. If this link is missing, the browser cannot see the files.

## The Solution (Run these commands)

1.  **Login to cPanel**
2.  **Open "Terminal"** (Search for "Terminal" in the cPanel dashboard)
3.  **Run the following commands exactly:**

```bash
# 1. Go to your project folder
cd /home/chilloc1/sistemdatapengundi.com/

# 2. Delete the existing (broken) link if it exists
rm public/storage

# 3. Create a fresh symbolic link
php artisan storage:link
```

### Expected Output
You should see: `The [public/storage] link has been connected to [storage/app/public].`

## Verification
1.  Go to your website and refresh the page.
2.  Upload a NEW image.
3.  It should now appear correctly.

## Note on Old Images
This fix will make **new** uploads work immediately.
For **old** images (uploaded locally), you still need to manually upload them via File Manager as described in `TROUBLESHOOTING_IMAGES.txt`.
