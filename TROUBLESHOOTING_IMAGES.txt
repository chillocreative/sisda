# Troubleshooting: Missing Images & Production Errors

## Problem 1: Missing Images (404 Error)
**Error:** `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404` for files like `b5dL902....jpg`.

### Cause
Uploaded files (like Kad Pengenalan images) are stored in `storage/app/public`. These files are **NOT** tracked by Git (because of `.gitignore`), so they are **NOT** automatically deployed to the production server when you push code.

### Solution
You must manually transfer the uploaded files from your local computer to the production server.

#### Option A: Using cPanel File Manager (Easiest)
1. **On your local computer:**
   - Go to your project folder: `d:\laragon\www\SISDA\storage\app\public`
   - Select all files/folders inside this directory.
   - Compress them into a ZIP file (e.g., `uploads.zip`).

2. **On cPanel:**
   - Go to **File Manager**.
   - Navigate to your project's storage directory: `/home/chilloc1/sistemdatapengundi.com/storage/app/public/`
   - Click **Upload** and upload your `uploads.zip`.
   - Right-click `uploads.zip` and select **Extract**.
   - Ensure the files are extracted directly into `public` (not a subfolder).

#### Option B: Using FTP (FileZilla)
1. Connect to your server using FTP.
2. Navigate to `/home/chilloc1/sistemdatapengundi.com/storage/app/public/` on the remote site.
3. Navigate to `d:\laragon\www\SISDA\storage\app\public\` on your local site.
4. Drag and drop all files/folders to upload them.

### Verification
After uploading, check if the symbolic link exists:
1. In cPanel Terminal, run:
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/chilloc1/sistemdatapengundi.com/public/storage
   ```
2. It should point to `../storage/app/public`. If not, run:
   ```bash
   cd /home/chilloc1/sistemdatapengundi.com/
   php artisan storage:link --force
   ```

## Problem 2: "Message channel closed" Error
**Error:** `Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response...`

### Cause
This is usually caused by **Browser Extensions** (like AdBlock, LastPass, or Grammarly) interfering with the page load, especially when a resource (like the image above) fails to load (404).

### Solution
1. **Fix the 404 error first** (follow steps above).
2. If the error persists, it is likely harmless and only visible in the console.
3. To confirm it's an extension:
   - Open the page in **Incognito/Private Mode** (where extensions are disabled).
   - If the error disappears, it confirms an extension is the cause.
